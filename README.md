# GzipCompressor
Meet a situation that needs to use Gzip to compress and decompress a JSON string during work, I write this solution down into a library for future usage.
This Compressor suppors both sychronous and asynchronous methods for stream and strings.
If this repository could help you with how to use Gzip compress in .NET, that's my pleasure.
